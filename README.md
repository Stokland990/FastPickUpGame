# FastPickUpGame
This is a small game made with Unreal Engine 5 with the purpuse of showing some of my skills.

Please keep in mind that the project is just an example of my code and I did not refactor it to perfection, so there are lots of things to improve. 

You can play alone or with your friend. If you decided to test the game with a friend please use the local network or hamachi, because you have to enter an IP to join the host. 

# Game Rules
The rules are simple. You have to collect more of the needed items (you can see the name of the item in the left corner of UI) than your opponent (or just a random number, if you are in single-player mode).

# Game Build
If you want to test out just the build of the game you can download it here:
